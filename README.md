07_HeapLab
==============

Implement a heap in C++

Requirements
------------

1. `add` and `remove` should be O(log n), except for `grow` which can be O(n)
2. Do not leak memory

Reading
=======
"Open Data Structures," Chapter 10, just the intro and section 1. http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/10_Heaps.html

Questions
=========

#### 1. Which of the above requirements work, and which do not? For each requirement, write a brief response.

1. add, remove O(logn), grow O(n).
2. deconstructor deletes backingArray, I believe I am not leaking memory. (Do I need a delete call in the remove function to accomplish that?)

#### 2. Exercises 10.1 and 10.2 from http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/10_3_Discussion_Exercises.html

#### 3. Exercise 10.4 from http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/10_3_Discussion_Exercises.html

#### 4. What is one question that confused you about this exercise, or one piece of advice you would share with students next semester?

it is a good idea to test your own code, and not just leave it to the pre-made tests.
